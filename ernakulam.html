                        of different endangered species of migratory birds. This thick deciduous forest has plantations
                        of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through it. Make sure to bring along a pair of

                        Kochi is popular for its old-world colonial charm, and still showcases every single cultural
                        change it has gone through over the centuries. One can spot remnants of Portuguese and Dutch
                        colonialism in this quaint city which is dotted with similar structures and has an overall
                        ambience that brings to light the colonial powers that once ruled over the place. The fort
                        region of Kochi has witnessed the rise and fall of great powers including the Portuguese,
                        Chinese and the Dutch, before it came under the nation-wide British rule in the 18th century.
                        Fort Kochi is lined with old European structures, churches and other architectural buildings
                        which transport you back to a different era. Unlike most other forts in Indian history, Fort
                        Kochi is not about historical fortifications, canons and ruins of old palatial buildings.
                        Instead, it houses the vibe of an ancient colonial city with its cobbled streets, colourful and
                        charming buildings and a picturesque view of the beach, and is one of the best places to see in
                        Ernakulam.</p>
