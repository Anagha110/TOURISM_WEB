                        Napier Museum is certainly one of the most visited tourist places in Trivandrum. Situated in the
                        Museum compound, the ground floor of this place houses India’s oldest zoological garden. Another

                    <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 60px;">Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Sree Padmanabhaswamy
                        Temple
                        is one of the famous places to visit. This holy shrine is one of the 108 abodes of Lord Vishnu.
                        A
                        large number of devotees throng the temple on multiple occasions.

                        The place of worship has lent its names to the capital city as ‘Thiru’ ‘Anantha’ ‘Puram’, which
                        means Sacred Abode of Lord Anantha Padmanabha. Dravidian style of architecture is prominent in
                        this
                        holy structure.

                        The chief attraction is the deity of Padmanabhaswamy, enshrined in a reclining posture. However,
                        the
                        main deity remains that of Lord Vishnu and his heavenly consorts namely, Sridevi and Bhudevi.
                        The
                        sacred idol is covered with a special ayurveda mixture that helps in keeping the plaster intact
                        and
                        clean. Devotees donate a large sum of money and precious articles in this temple. The assets are
                        believed to be value around 90,000 crores. The invaluable donations are kept safe in 6 different
                        cellars.

                        Padmanabhaswamy Temple should definitely be included in the itinerary of the places to visit in
                        Trivandrum. Indeed, the temple remains impeccable in appearance and religious sentiments

Far from the hustle and bustle of the city, this place is known for breath-taking sunrises and sunsets; visit to this beach is one of the best things to do in Trivandrum The calm environs and exquisite shoreline here is undoubtedly commendable.

                        The beach is also considered as the ‘Arattukadavu’ (Seat) of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan. Shamghumukham is also a prime location for the Ganesha Visarjan, where millions of Hindu devotees throng during the Vinayaka Chaturthi.
                        
                        The best time of the year to visit here is around the Arattu festival. The beach is swarmed with large processions, carrying the deities of Lord Padmanabhawamy, Lord Narasimha and Lord Krishna and led by the former Maharaja of Travancore. The Maharaja is escorted by members of the Royal family, temple authorities, armed guards, police, and officers. The ceremonial bath in this place marks the conclusion of the festival, after which the deities are taken back to their respective temples by the procession.
                        
                        Preferred due to its isolated location and picturesque landscape, Shanghumukham is the pride of Trivandrum. The famous sculpture of a Mermaid (Jalkanyka) carved by Raja Ravi Varma is an added delight. The sculpture is more than 35m long and is an exemplary piece of art.
